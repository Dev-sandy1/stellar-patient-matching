# Stellar Patient Matching: Architectural Decisions & Implementation Notes

This document captures the key architectural decisions made during development, the rationale behind them, and their impact on the system.

---

## 🎯 **Core Design Philosophy**

**Goal:** Build a production-ready TEE-based clinical trial matching system that works for both MVP demo and real-world deployment.

**Approach:** Dual-mode architecture that gracefully falls back from real TEE to mock TEE, enabling rapid development and testing without compromising production architecture.

---

## 📊 **Major Architectural Decisions**

### **1. Dual Storage Strategy (Backend + TEE)**

**Decision:** Store trials in both JavaScript Map (backend) and TEE KV store (contracts).

**Rationale:**
- Backend storage enables fast queries for UI (list trials, search, filter)
- TEE storage provides secure cross-tenant access for confidential matching
- Graceful fallback: MockTEEClient uses backend only, real TEE uses both
- Production-ready: supports both development and deployment modes

**Implementation:**
- `POST /api/trials/create` stores in backend Map
- If using real TEE, also calls `teeClient.publishTrial()` to store in KV map
- MockTEEClient reads from backend Map
- Real TEE reads from KV map

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/routes/trials.ts` - Added TEE publishing logic
- `server/src/tee-client.ts` - Added `publishTrial()` method
- `contracts/pharma-trial/src/publish.rs` - Stores in KV map

---

### **2. Direct DID Passing (Not Placeholder-Based)**

**Decision:** Pass patient DID directly as input parameter instead of using Terminal 3's placeholder system (`{{profile.patient_id}}`).

**Rationale:**
- **Simpler implementation** - No complex placeholder resolution setup
- **More explicit** - Contract knows exactly which patient to evaluate
- **Easier debugging** - Can see DID in logs and traces
- **Still secure** - TEE guarantees apply regardless of input method
- **MVP-appropriate** - Reduces complexity for hackathon timeline

**Implementation:**
```rust
struct CheckEligibilityInput {
    trial_id: String,
    patient_did: String,  // Direct DID
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `contracts/hospital-screening/src/eligibility.rs` - Added `patient_did` field
- `contracts/hospital-screening/src/lib.rs` - Removed `get_patient_profile_fields`
- `contracts/hospital-screening/wit/world.wit` - Removed function from interface
- Deleted `contracts/hospital-screening/src/profile.rs`

---

### **3. Dynamic EHR URL Configuration**

**Decision:** Store EHR base URL in secrets vault instead of hardcoding in WASM.

**Rationale:**
- **Environment flexibility** - Switch between dev/staging/prod without recompiling
- **Multi-tenant support** - Different hospitals can use different backends
- **Production-ready** - Follows security best practices (secrets in vault)
- **Follows existing pattern** - API keys already stored this way

**Implementation:**
```rust
fn get_ehr_base_url() -> Result<String, String> {
    let tid = tenant_context::tenant_did();
    let map_name = format!("z:{}:secrets", hex::encode(&tid));
    let bytes = kv_store::get(&map_name, b"ehr_base_url")?;
    String::from_utf8(bytes)
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `contracts/hospital-screening/src/eligibility.rs` - Added `get_ehr_base_url()`
- `server/src/scripts/setup.ts` - Seeds `ehr_base_url` in secrets vault
- `server/.env` - Added `EHR_BASE_URL` variable

---

### **4. Patient Data Stored in Backend (Not External EHR)**

**Decision:** Patients upload health data to Stellar Patient Matching backend, not external EHR system.

**Rationale:**
- **MVP simplification** - No need to integrate with hospital EHR systems
- **User control** - Patients own and manage their data
- **Still TEE-secured** - Data flows through TEE enclave for matching
- **Extensible** - Can add external EHR integration later

**Implementation:**
- Frontend: Patient uploads → `POST /api/patients/upload`
- Backend: Stores in Map (`patientsStore`)
- Contract: Calls `GET /api/patients/:did/records` via `http-with-placeholders`
- TEE enclave: Fetches data, evaluates, returns result

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/routes/patients.ts` - Added `/patients/:did/records` endpoint
- `contracts/hospital-screening/src/eligibility.rs` - Updated URL to backend

---

### **5. Removed TenantClient Instances**

**Decision:** Use `agentClient.executeAndDecode()` directly instead of `TenantClient` wrappers.

**Rationale:**
- **Simpler code** - One client instead of three (agent, pharma, hospital)
- **More explicit** - Script names show exactly which contract is called
- **Agent-appropriate** - Matches the agent-based authorization model
- **No functional difference** - TenantClient is just a wrapper around T3nClient

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Before:
await this.pharmaTenant.execute({ function_name: "get-trial-criteria", ... })

// After:
await this.agentClient.executeAndDecode({
  script_name: "z:{pharmaTenantId}:patient-matching",
  script_version: "0.1.0",
  function_name: "get-trial-criteria",
  ...
})
```

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/tee-client.ts` - Removed `pharmaTenant` and `hospitalTenant`

---

### **6. MockTEEClient Dynamic Data Sources**

**Decision:** MockTEEClient reads from trials and patients stores dynamically instead of hardcoded mock data.

**Rationale:**
- **Consistent behavior** - Mock matches real TEE behavior
- **Development speed** - Test real data flows without TEE setup
- **Integration testing** - Backend routes work with mock client
- **Demo-ready** - Can demo full flow without T3N credentials

**Implementation:**
```typescript
async checkEligibility(trialId: string, patientDid: string) {
  const { getTrialsStore } = await import("./routes/trials");
  const trial = getTrialsStore().get(trialId);
  const patientData = getPatientData(patientDid);
  return evaluateCriteria(trial.criteria, patientData);
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/tee-client.ts` - Updated `MockTEEClient` methods
- `server/src/routes/trials.ts` - Exported `getTrialsStore()`
- `server/src/routes/patients.ts` - Exported `getPatientData()`

---

### **7. Authorization Uses Dynamic Backend URL**

**Decision:** `allowedHosts` reads from environment variable instead of hardcoded host.

**Rationale:**
- **Environment flexibility** - Works with localhost, staging, production
- **No authorization recompile** - Change URL without re-running authorize script
- **Matches contract URL** - Backend URL consistent across system

**Implementation:**
```typescript
allowedHosts: [
  process.env.EHR_BASE_URL?.replace(/^https?:\/\//, "") || "localhost:3008"
]
```

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/scripts/authorize.ts` - Dynamic host extraction

---

### **8. Agent-Driven Batch Matching Architecture**

**Decision:** Implement autonomous agent-driven batch matching where hospital/pharma deploys one agent per trial, and the agent proactively scans all patients to find eligible matches.

**Previous Architecture (Rejected):**
```
Patient-Initiated Flow:
1. Patient searches for trials manually
2. Patient clicks "Check Eligibility" for each trial
3. TEE contract checks one patient against one trial
4. Patient repeats for every trial

Problems:
- High patient friction (must actively search)
- Inefficient (one-by-one checking)
- No agent value proposition (just automated logic)
- Doesn't solve core problem: slow enrollment timelines
- Agent identity has no meaningful purpose
```

**New Architecture (Adopted):**
```
Agent-Driven Batch Matching:
1. Patient uploads health data once → Done
2. Hospital creates trial → Clicks "Deploy Agent"
3. Agent (one per trial) automatically:
   a. Fetches all patient DIDs from backend
   b. Calls TEE contract for each patient
   c. TEE processes eligibility inside enclave
   d. Agent collects eligible patients
   e. Returns aggregated results + eligible DIDs
4. Hospital receives match summary (no PHI exposure)

Benefits:
✅ Solves real problem: "80% of trials fail enrollment"
✅ Agent has compelling use case: Autonomous batch matching
✅ Reduces patient friction: Upload once, agent finds trials
✅ Time savings: Hospital clicks once → scans thousands
✅ Privacy preserved: Agent sees eligibility only, not medical data
✅ Agent identity meaningful: Patients authorize agent DID
✅ Audit trail: Every match logged with agent signature
```

---

#### **8.1 Agent Identity & Authorization**

**Decision:** Create one agent per trial with automatic patient authorization.

**Rationale:**
- **One Agent Per Trial** - Each trial gets its own agent DID (named after trial)
  - Easy to debug and manage
  - Clear audit trail (which agent matched which patients)
  - Agent lifecycle tied to trial lifecycle
  
- **Automatic Authorization** - Patients don't manually authorize agents
  - Platform usage implies consent
  - Reduced user friction (no extra steps)
  - Agents pre-authorized during patient registration
  - Patients trust platform, not individual agents

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// When trial is created and "Deploy Agent" is clicked:
const agentDid = `did:t3n:agent-${trialId}`;

// Agent automatically has permission to:
1. Read patient DIDs from backend
2. Invoke hospital screening contract
3. Access patient health_records via TEE only
```

**Agent Naming Convention:**
- Format: `did:t3n:agent-{trialName}-{trialId}`
- Example: `did:t3n:agent-nsclc-immunotherapy-TRIAL-2026-001`

---

#### **8.2 Agent Execution Model**

**Decision:** On-demand agent execution with optional scheduled runs.

**Execution Modes:**

1. **On-Demand (MVP)**
   - Hospital clicks "Deploy Agent" button
   - Agent runs immediately
   - Scans all current patients
   - Returns results in real-time

2. **Scheduled (Future - Roadmap)**
   - Cron job every 2 days
   - Checks for new patient uploads
   - Runs agent only if new patients exist
   - Batches patients efficiently (e.g., 4 patients every 2 days vs 2 daily)
   - Avoids useless LLM calls

**Rationale:**
- On-demand for MVP: Immediate feedback for hospitals
- Scheduled for production: Efficient resource usage
- 2-day interval: Balance between freshness and cost

---

#### **8.3 Agent Result Caching & Database Storage**

**Decision:** Agent stores ALL match results (eligible AND non-eligible) in database during batch run.

**Problem with Original Design:**
```json
// Agent only returned eligible patients
{
  "eligiblePatients": [{"patientDid": "did:t3n:patient-001", ...}],
  "summary": {"screened": 50, "eligible": 2, "notEligible": 48}
}
```
- ❌ No data for 48 non-eligible patients
- ❌ When non-eligible patient visits trial → Must run TEE check again
- ❌ Cache only helps 2/50 patients (4%)
- ❌ Defeats purpose of batch matching

**Corrected Architecture:**
```typescript
// Agent stores EVERY result in database
for (const patientDid of allPatients) {
  const result = await teeClient.checkEligibility(trialId, patientDid);
  
  await cacheMatchResult({
    trialId,
    patientDid,
    eligible: result.eligible,
    confidence: result.confidence,
    matchedCriteria: result.matched_criteria,
    totalCriteria: result.total_criteria,
    checkedAt: new Date(),
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 days
  });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Agent runs once → Caches 50/50 patients (100%)
- ✅ Patient visits trial page → Fetch from cache (no TEE call)
- ✅ Works for both eligible AND non-eligible patients
- ✅ Only re-runs TEE if:
  - Cache expired (> 7 days)
  - Patient updated health records
  - Trial criteria changed

**Cache Invalidation:**
```typescript
// When patient uploads new health records
await invalidatePatientMatches(patientDid);

// When trial criteria changes
await invalidateTrialMatches(trialId);
```

**API Response Format:**

**Pharma Agent Run (for pharma dashboard):**
```json
{
  "eligiblePatients": [
    {
      "patientDid": "did:t3n:patient-001",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "matchedCriteria": 10,
      "totalCriteria": 10
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "screened": 50,
    "eligible": 2,
    "eligibilityRate": "4%"
  }
}
```

**Patient Individual Check (with cache):**
```json
{
  "eligibility": {
    "eligible": false,
    "confidence": 0.45,
    "matched_criteria": 3,
    "total_criteria": 10,
    "details": "AI-generated explanation here..."
  },
  "cached": true,
  "trial": {
    "id": "TRIAL-2026-001",
    "name": "NSCLC Immunotherapy"
  }
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/services/match-cache.ts` - Cache management service
- `server/src/services/agent-deployment.ts` - Store results during batch run
- `server/src/routes/trials.ts` - Check cache before TEE call
- `server/src/routes/patients-new.ts` - Invalidate cache on upload

---

#### **8.4 Privacy Preservation in Agent Flow**

**What Agent Can See:**
```
✅ Patient DIDs (identifiers)
✅ Eligibility results: { eligible: bool, confidence: number }
✅ Match counts: { matched: 8, total: 10 }
❌ Medical records
❌ Diagnosis codes
❌ Medications
❌ Lab results
❌ Reasons for match/failure (would expose PHI)
```

**What Hospital/Pharma Can See:**
```
✅ List of eligible patient DIDs
✅ Match confidence scores
✅ Aggregated statistics
❌ Patient medical data (unless patient explicitly shares later)
❌ Reasons for eligibility (prevents PHI leakage)
```

**TEE Processing Flow:**
```
Agent → TEE Contract (Inside Enclave):
  1. Download patient data (http-with-placeholders)
  2. Call LLM to extract structured data
  3. Evaluate trial criteria
  4. Return: { eligible: true, confidence: 0.95 }
     ↓
Agent receives ONLY eligibility boolean (NO PHI)
```

---

#### **8.5 Addressing Sponsor (Terminal 3) Technology Integration**

**Challenge:** Ensure the solution meaningfully uses Terminal 3 ADK, not just a traditional API that could work without TEE.

**How This Architecture Uses ADK Properly:**

1. **Agent Identity (DIDs)**
   - Each agent has cryptographic DID
   - Agent signs every contract invocation
   - Immutable audit trail on T3N ledger
   - **WHY ADK:** Traditional systems don't have cryptographic agent identity

2. **Patient Authorization**
   - Patients grant specific agents access to screening contract
   - Authorization recorded on-chain
   - Revocable permissions
   - **WHY ADK:** Traditional systems lack user-controlled authorization

3. **TEE-Protected Data Access**
   - Patient data decrypted ONLY inside Intel TDX enclave
   - LLM calls made from inside TEE
   - Agent never sees raw medical data
   - **WHY ADK:** Traditional systems expose data to backend/agent

4. **Cross-Tenant Calls**
   - Agent calls hospital contract to access pharma trial criteria
   - Hospital contract reads pharma KV maps (with ACLs)
   - Zero-knowledge cross-boundary data sharing
   - **WHY ADK:** Traditional systems require data duplication or shared databases

5. **Immutable Audit Trail**
   - Every agent match logged on T3N ledger
   - Regulators can verify matching happened inside TEE
   - Cryptographic proof of contract version used
   - **WHY ADK:** Traditional systems have mutable/forgeable logs

**Result:** The agent MUST operate through TEE to access patient data. Without ADK, this privacy-preserving batch matching would be impossible.

---

#### **8.6 Contact Flow (Future - Not MVP)**

**Planned Features (Roadmap):**

1. **Email-Based Contact**
   - Patients register with email
   - Email stored in MongoDB (not PHI)
   - Hospital can request contact
   - Platform sends email to eligible patients
   - Patient explicitly consents to share data with hospital

2. **In-Platform Messaging (Requires WebSockets)**
   - Real-time chat between hospital and patient
   - Patient controls conversation initiation
   - Messages encrypted end-to-end
   - **Deferred:** Avoids WebSocket complexity for MVP

3. **Consent Management**
   - Patient dashboard shows which hospitals requested contact
   - Granular consent: "Share diagnosis only", "Share all records", etc.
   - Time-limited data sharing
   - Revocable at any time

---

#### **8.7 Implementation Impact**

**New Backend Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/trials/{trialId}/deploy-agent
  → Creates agent DID
  → Triggers batch matching workflow
  → Returns: { eligiblePatients, summary }

GET /api/patients/list
  → Returns: [did:t3n:p1, did:t3n:p2, ...]
  → Used by agent to fetch patient DIDs
```

**Agent Workflow:**
```typescript
async function deployAgent(trialId: string) {
  // 1. Create agent identity
  const agentDid = await createAgentIdentity(trialId);
  
  // 2. Fetch all patient DIDs
  const patientDids = await fetchPatientDids();
  
  // 3. Batch check eligibility
  const results = [];
  for (const patientDid of patientDids) {
    const result = await teeClient.checkEligibility(trialId, patientDid);
    results.push({ patientDid, ...result });
  }
  
  // 4. Filter eligible patients
  const eligible = results.filter(r => r.eligible);
  
  // 5. Generate summary (no PHI)
  const summary = {
    screened: results.length,
    eligible: eligible.length,
    eligibilityRate: `${(eligible.length / results.length * 100).toFixed(1)}%`,
  };
  
  // 6. Return results
  return { eligiblePatients: eligible, summary };
}
```

**Files to Change:**
- `server/src/routes/trials.ts` - Add `/deploy-agent` endpoint
- `server/src/routes/patients.ts` - Add `/list` endpoint
- `server/src/services/agent-deployment.ts` - New agent workflow logic
- `server/src/tee-client.ts` - Batch matching helpers

#### **8.8 Comparison: Old vs New Architecture**

| Aspect | Old Architecture | New Architecture |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Patient Effort** | Manually search and check each trial | Upload once, agent finds trials |
| **Matching Speed** | One-by-one per patient request | Batch scan all patients at once |
| **Agent Purpose** | None (just automated logic) | Autonomous batch matching |
| **Hospital UX** | Wait for patients to find trial | Click "Deploy Agent" → instant results |
| **Enrollment Speed** | Slow (patients must search) | Fast (agent proactively matches) |
| **Agent Identity** | No meaningful DID usage | Each trial gets dedicated agent DID |
| **Audit Trail** | Patient-initiated actions only | Agent actions logged with signature |
| **Privacy** | Same (TEE enclave) | Same (TEE enclave) |
| **Scalability** | Poor (per-patient requests) | Excellent (batch processing) |
| **Problem Solved** | Doesn't address enrollment failure | Directly solves slow enrollment |

---

#### **8.9 Roadmap Integration**

**MVP (Current Sprint):**
- ✅ On-demand agent deployment
- ✅ Batch eligibility checking
- ✅ Aggregated results (no PHI)
- ✅ Eligible patient DIDs returned

**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**
- ⏱️ Scheduled agent runs (every 2 days)
- ⏱️ Email-based patient contact
- ⏱️ Consent management UI

**Phase 3 (Future):**
- 📅 In-platform messaging (WebSockets)
- 📅 Partial match recommendations (failed 1-2 criteria)
- 📅 AI-powered eligibility explanations (without PHI)

---

**Architectural Decision Summary:**

This redesign transforms Stellar Patient Matching from a patient-initiated search tool into an **autonomous agent-driven matching platform**. The agent has a clear, compelling purpose: **proactively finding eligible patients for trials**. This directly solves the core problem stated in `Problem-statement.md`: "80% of clinical trials fail to meet enrollment timelines."

By leveraging Terminal 3 ADK's cryptographic agent identity, TEE-protected data access, and immutable audit trails, the solution meaningfully uses sponsor technology while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.

---

### **9. Platform Controls Hospital Infrastructure (No Hospital Onboarding)**

**Decision:** Platform acts as the hospital tenant - no separate hospital onboarding UI needed.

**Rationale:**
- **Platform = Hospital Infrastructure Owner**
  - The Stellar Patient Matching platform controls the EHR backend
  - Platform runs the hospital TEE contract
  - Platform manages patient data storage (MongoDB → T3N profiles)
  - Hospital role is infrastructure, not end-user

- **Pharma = External Users**
  - Pharma companies are external organizations
  - Each pharma brings their own T3N DID
  - Pharma needs registration/login UI
  - Multiple pharma organizations can use the platform

- **Agent Deployment Model**
  - Pharma creates trial → Platform deploys agent
  - Agent uses platform's hospital contract
  - Agent scans platform's patient database
  - Results returned to pharma organization

**Frontend Impact:**
- ❌ No `/hospital` routes needed
- ✅ `/pharma/onboarding` for pharma registration
- ✅ `/pharma/trials` for pharma trial management
- ✅ `/patient/*` routes for patients (end users)

**Backend Architecture:**
```
Platform (Hospital Tenant):
  - Controls hospital-screening contract
  - Manages patient records
  - Executes TEE eligibility checks
  - Deploys agents on behalf of pharma

Pharma Organizations (External Tenants):
  - Register with their T3N DID
  - Create trials via platform
  - Deploy agents to scan patients
  - Receive match results
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear separation: Platform infrastructure vs. Pharma users
- Reduces complexity: No need for hospital user accounts
- Real-world model: EHR platforms (Epic, Cerner) control infrastructure, pharma accesses via API
- MVP-appropriate: Single hospital backend, multiple pharma organizations

**Files Changed:**
- `Frontend/src/routes/pharma/onboarding/+page.svelte` - Pharma registration/login
- `Frontend/src/lib/stores/pharma.svelte.ts` - Pharma session management
- `server/src/routes/pharma.ts` - Pharma organization endpoints
- Removed: `Frontend/src/routes/hospital/` (not needed)

---

### **10. Stitch Screens Development Artifacts Excluded**

**Decision:** Exclude `Frontend/src/lib/stitch-screens` folder from version control.

**Rationale:**
- **Development-only artifacts** - Contains HTML snapshots and screenshots used for UI prototyping
- **Not production code** - These files are not imported or used by the application
- **Large binary files** - Screenshots increase repository size unnecessarily
- **No runtime dependency** - Removing them doesn't affect application functionality

**Content:**
- `html/` - Static HTML prototypes for rapid UI iteration
- `screenshots/` - Screen captures for design reference and documentation

**Files Changed:**
- `Frontend/.gitignore` - Added `src/lib/stitch-screens/`
- Repository history - Untracked existing files

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**
